Covered topics: many aspects of front end development, including writing semantic HTML, fundamentals of CSS styling, working with design files, forms and advanced CSS (building fluid layouts and responsive design). The curriculum is capped off with projects reinforcing the concepts learnt and ends with a project that familiarizes you with a typical workflow for projects built from the ground-up.
